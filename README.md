# CPI Game Graphics Labs
 
This repository contains several lab results from Game Graphics course.

To run each sample, simply run each lab project in visual studio as new instance except lab 11 (unity project).

For lab 11, import the project into unity and run.

All shader file (.fx) are stored in Labxx/Content (Ex. Lab07/Content/BumpMap.fx)

**If an error occurs while running, it may because of the out dated frameworks, please choose continue running to see the result.**
